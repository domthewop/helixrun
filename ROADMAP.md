# HelixRUN Development Roadmap

Our mission is to deliver a solid foundation for rapidly setting up full-featured 
APIs. We believe in building software that is robust, scalable, and adaptable to evolving 
business needs. This roadmap outlines our strategic development plan, guiding us from an initial 
monolithic architecture to a scalable, microservices-based system.

## Phase 1: Establishing the Monolith
- **Objective**: To have a functional, production-ready application as quickly as possible.
- **Tasks**:
    - Design and implement core API endpoints.
    - Integrate with PostgreSQL for data persistence.
    - Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    - Ensure comprehensive test coverage for all features.

## Phase 2: Transition to Microservices
- **Objective**: Decompose the monolithic application into distinct, loosely-coupled 
microservices to achieve better scalability and maintainability.
- **Tasks**:
    - Identify and define microservice boundaries.
    - Decompose monolithic components into individual microservices.
    - Set up inter-service communication mechanisms.
    - Establish centralized logging and monitoring for microservices.

## Phase 3: Containerization with Docker
- **Objective**: To encapsulate microservices in containers, ensuring environment consistency, 
isolation, and ease of deployment.
- **Tasks**:
    - Create Dockerfiles for each microservice.
    - Set up a Docker Compose environment for local development.
    - Design and implement a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline 
for container builds and deployments.

## Phase 4: Implementing Service Discovery
- **Objective**: To facilitate dynamic discovery of microservices, ensuring efficient routing, 
load balancing, and resilience.
- **Tasks**:
    - Evaluate and choose an appropriate service discovery tool or platform.
    - Integrate service discovery into the microservices ecosystem.
    - Implement health checks for services to ensure availability and reliability.
    - Document and provide examples for the community on leveraging service discovery with 
HelixRUN.

## Future Enhancements and Considerations:
- **API Gateway**: Introducing an API gateway to manage requests and distribute them across 
microservices, offering additional features like rate limiting, caching, and API documentation.

- **Database Sharding and Partitioning**: As data grows, consider strategies for horizontal 
scaling of databases.

- **OpenTelemetry Integration**: For distributed tracing and gaining insights into the behavior 
and performance of the system.

- **Community Contributions**: We value community input and contributions. As the project 
evolves, we'll be updating this roadmap based on feedback, new technology trends, and the needs 
of the HelixRUN community.
