# License FAQ for HelixRUN

HelixRUN is released under a unique license that might prompt a few questions. We've created this 
FAQ to address some of these questions and offer clarity.

## 1. Why does HelixRUN have a revocable license?

HelixRUN is intended to be an open-source project, but we recognize the importance of safeguarding 
the software from potential misuse by entities that may act against the best interests of the 
community. The revocation clause offers a mechanism to address this, ensuring that HelixRUN 
remains in hands that align with its core principles.

## 2. What's the story with Python 2.0's copyright?

Python 2.0's copyright is held by BeOpen.com, a company where I was an executive, operating as the
Vice President of Business Development. BeOpen.com employed the original Python team, including 
Guido van Rossum. Upon the company's dissolution, many assets were distributed among employees in 
lieu of unpaid payroll. In addition to computer equipment, one of the assets I chose was the 
Python 2.0 copyright, thereby making me the personal copyright holder.

This anecdote is shared to illustrate a unique instance in software licensing and to highlight 
the complex and varied nature of open-source licensing. It's essential to understand the origins 
and implications of software licenses, especially when building upon or integrating such 
software into new projects.

## 3. How does the revocation clause work?

The license grants all the standard permissions you'd expect from the MIT license. However, the 
revocation clause gives the licensor the right to revoke the license for any entity at their 
discretion. Entities are informed of such revocation in writing, upon which they must cease all 
activities involving the software. This clause's primary intent is to deter and address misuse.

## 4. Will the revocation clause deter contributors or users?

We understand that a revocable license is non-traditional in the open-source world. Our hope is 
that by being transparent about our reasons and intentions, users and contributors will 
appreciate the safeguarding measures. We encourage everyone to thoroughly review the license 
and consider if it aligns with their goals before using or contributing to HelixRUN.

## 5. What if I have more questions about the license?
