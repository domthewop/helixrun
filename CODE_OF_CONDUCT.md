# Code of Conduct for HelixRUN

## 1. Introduction

At HelixRUN, we are committed to fostering a welcoming, inclusive, and safe environment for 
everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, or any 
other group status. This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for participant behavior 
and the steps for reporting unacceptable behavior.

All contributors, maintainers, and community members are required to adhere to this Code of 
Conduct, both online and during in-person events related to the project.

## 2. Expected Behavior

We expect all members of our community to:

- **Be Respectful**: Value each other's ideas, styles, and viewpoints. We may not always agree, 
but disagreement is no excuse for poor manners.
- **Be Direct but Professional**: We are likely to have some discussions about hard problems. 
The best way to get to good solutions is by having open, honest, and respectful conversations.
- **Choose Your Words Wisely**: Always conduct yourself professionally. Avoid using offensive, 
racist, homophobic, or sexist terminology or language.

## 3. Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered unacceptable within our community:

- Violence, threats of violence, or violent language directed against another person.
- Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and 
language.
- Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
- Posting or threatening to post other people's personally identifying information (known as 
"doxxing").
- Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, 
or disability.
- Any form of harassment or unwelcome attention.
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviors.

## 4. Reporting & Enforcement

If someone violates this Code of Conduct, please report it by contacting us at
[dmerenda@gmail.com](mailto:dmerenda@gmail.com). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated 
fairly and as promptly as possible.

Those who fail to comply with our Code of Conduct may face temporary bans, permanent bans, or 
other forms of retribution, as deemed appropriate by the project creator.
