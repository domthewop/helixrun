> "Twist, Turn, Launch: Your API journey starts here."

HelixRUN is a foundation for rapidly setting up and deploying full-featured APIs.
Designed with the intention of serving as a blueprint for developers, HelixRUN ensures that 
you start your project on the right foot. Currently, HelixRUN is an opinionated system without 
room for flexibility around technology choices. The roadmap includes plans to change this.

## Mission

Our mission is to simplify the process of setting up reliable, scalable, and efficient APIs. 
With the vast and evolving landscape of backend development, we aim to provide a consistent and 
robust starting point for developers, reducing the initial setup time and allowing them to focus 
on feature development. With a minimum amount of experience with backend APIs, databases, and AWS, 
you should be able to deploy a production-ready API rapidly using HelixRUN.

## Features

- **Rapid Setup**: Get your API up and running in minimal time.
- **Scalability**: Built with the right amount of best practices to ensure your API scales with 
your needs, without adding too much weight to the initial deployment.
- **Security**: Prioritizing security measures from the start.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Node.js and PostgreSQL installed.
2. **Installation**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/domthewop/helixrun
    cd helixrun
    npm install
    ```
3. **Running** (in dev):
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
